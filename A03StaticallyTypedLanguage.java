         * Java is a Statically typed language which means firstly we have to 
         * define the variable type for storing the data. 
         * Like int, float, double, byte, short, etc.
         * 
         * Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as static typed 
         * if the memory of the variable is provided at the compilation time.
         * Ex: C, C++, Java, etc.
         * 
         * Dynamically Typed: Programming language are said to as dynamically typed 
         * if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.
         * There is no need to define the type of the variable.
         * Ex: Python, PHP, JavaScript
