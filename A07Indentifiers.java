         * Identifiers : Name of classes, Variables, functions.
         * 
         * Rules to name an Identifier:
         * The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric 
         * characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), ‘$‘(dollar sign) and ‘_‘ (underscore).
         * 
         * Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). 
         * 
         * Java identifiers are case-sensitive. 
         * 
         * There is no limit on the length of the identifier, 
         * but it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only. 
         * 
         * Reserved Words can’t be used as an identifier. There are 53 reserved words in Java.
         * 
         * No white spaces are allowed.
         * 
         * Classes name should be written in PascalCase : HelloWorld, DataType, PrintingNumber
         * Variable name should be written in camelCase : firstName, sumOfNumber
         * function name should be written in camelcase : getName(), setValues()
         * 
         *      snake_case -> first_name -> Python follows snake_case
         *
